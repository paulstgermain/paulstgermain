ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Paul! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with 3 years of focused experience using technology to build products and solve problems for nonprofits and startups in the USA and the UK. 

## About
As a 90's kid, the internet has always been my favorite placeâ€”my playground, library, and space for creative expression. That lifelong love evolved into a passion for web development, where I bring energy, curiosity, and a mission-driven mindset to every project. I thrive when Iâ€™m using code to create positive change or inject some creativity and joy back into the online experience.
