## Hey, I'm Paul! 👋

- 💻 I've been coding for 3 years, mostly with React.js, but with accompanying experience with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Auth0, and more.
- 💡 I recently learned Dart, Flutter, and mobile app deployments for both iOS & Android!
- 🛠️ Recently deployed the MVP for [Vega](https://vega-drab.vercel.app/), a web app designed to help ease job search management and strategizing for job seekers in tech.
  - (See the [post about Vega on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paul-stgermain_devlife-upskilling-opentowork-activity-7232472151423922177-z9bf), or check out the pinned repos for more details!)
